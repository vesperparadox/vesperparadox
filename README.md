- 👋 Hi, I’m @vesperparadox
- 👀 I’m interested in being a front end developer, and creating apps to help people feel validated about their health & wellness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end development, specifically Javascript.
- 💞️ I loved creating websites in high school (with just HTML, CSS, and Photoshop), so I'm learning more advanced coding skills now.
- 📫 How to reach me - email me at mix.mapper-04@icloud.com
